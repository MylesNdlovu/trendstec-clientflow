## üîß What YOU Need to Do (5 Minutes)

Unfortunately, **I cannot programmatically configure Facebook App settings** due to security restrictions. You need to manually configure the Facebook App settings through the Facebook Developer Dashboard.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Add OAuth Redirect URIs (CRITICAL)

Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/1515799103199853/fb-login/settings/

Add these exact URIs:
```
http://localhost:5173/api/facebook/callback
https://my-svelte-j91inqb3h-myles-projects-dd515697.vercel.app/api/facebook/callback
```

Click **"Save Changes"**

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Basic Settings

Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/1515799103199853/settings/basic/

Set:
- **App Domains:** `localhost` and your production domain
- **Privacy Policy URL:** `http://localhost:5173/privacy` (for dev) or your production URL
- **User Support URL:** `http://localhost:5173/support` (for dev) or your production URL

Click **"Save Changes"**

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Enable Facebook Login Use Case

Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/1515799103199853/use_cases/

Find **"Authenticate and request data from users"**

Click **"Customize"** and ensure these permissions are enabled:
- ‚úÖ `email`
- ‚úÖ `public_profile`
- ‚úÖ `pages_show_list`
- ‚úÖ `pages_read_engagement`
- ‚úÖ `pages_manage_ads`
- ‚úÖ `business_management`
- ‚úÖ `ads_management`
- ‚úÖ `ads_read`

Click **"Save"**

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Check Security Settings

Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/1515799103199853/settings/advanced/

Under **"Security"**, make sure **"Require App Secret"** is **OFF** (unchecked)

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Set App Mode

- For **testing:** Keep in **Development Mode** and add your Facebook account as a tester/admin
- For **production:** Switch to **Live Mode** (requires all above settings to be complete)

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Errors

### Error: "URL Blocked: This redirect failed"
**Cause:** Redirect URI not configured in Facebook App
**Solution:** Add exact URI to Facebook Login Settings (Step 1 above)

### Error: "App Not Set Up: This app is still in development mode"
**Cause:** App is in Development Mode but you're not added as a tester
**Solution:** Either add yourself as a tester OR switch to Live Mode

### Error: "Can't Load URL: The domain of this URL isn't included in the app's domains"
**Cause:** Domain not in App Domains list
**Solution:** Add domain to Basic Settings > App Domains (Step 2 above)

### Error: "Missing Privacy Policy URL"
**Cause:** Privacy Policy not configured
**Solution:** Add privacy policy URL in Basic Settings (Step 2 above)

### OAuth works but shows "access_denied"
**Cause:** User denied permissions OR app doesn't have permission to request those scopes
**Solution:** Check Use Cases settings and ensure all required permissions are enabled (Step 3 above)

## üí° Why This Happened

Facebook requires manual configuration through their Developer Dashboard for security reasons. Key OAuth settings like redirect URIs, privacy policy, and permissions cannot be set programmatically via the Graph API. This prevents malicious apps from changing these critical security settings without human verification.

## üìû Need Help?

If you're still experiencing issues after following all steps:

1. Check the browser console (F12) for errors
2. Check the dev server terminal for server-side errors
3. Verify all URLs match EXACTLY (no typos, extra spaces, or trailing slashes)
4. Try in an incognito/private browsing window
5. Clear browser cache and cookies
6. Ensure you're logged into Facebook with an account that has access to the App
