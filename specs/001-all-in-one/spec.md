## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a **small business owner or entrepreneur**, I want to **manage my entire online business from one platform** so that I can **create sales funnels, sell products, manage customers, send marketing emails, automate data collection from the web, and track performance** without needing multiple separate tools and subscriptions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I'm a new user, **When** I sign up for the platform, **Then** I should be able to create my first funnel within 15 minutes using pre-built templates
2. **Given** I have products to sell, **When** I create a sales funnel, **Then** customers should be able to purchase and receive automated email sequences
3. **Given** I want to grow my audience, **When** I create a lead magnet funnel, **Then** visitors should be able to opt-in and receive my free content automatically
4. **Given** I'm running email campaigns, **When** I send broadcasts or set up automated sequences, **Then** I should see detailed analytics on opens, clicks, and conversions
5. **Given** I have customers, **When** they purchase products, **Then** the system should handle payments, deliver digital products, and track affiliate commissions automatically
6. **Given** I want to monitor competitors or collect market data, **When** I set up web scraping workflows with login credentials, **Then** the system should automatically extract protected data and trigger marketing actions based on the findings
7. **Given** I need leads from online directories, **When** I configure data collection rules with authentication, **Then** the system should scrape contact information from member areas and add them to my email sequences
8. **Given** I have login credentials for various platforms, **When** I set up authenticated scraping workflows, **Then** the system should automatically log in, extract data, and feed results directly into my automation triggers
9. **Given** I want to capture leads on any website, **When** I create and embed forms, **Then** visitors should be able to submit information that automatically triggers my email sequences and workflows
10. **Given** I'm a creator or influencer, **When** I promote other people's products, **Then** I should be able to access creator marketplace, get tracking links, and earn commissions automatically
11. **Given** I want to track user behavior anywhere, **When** I embed tracking pixels and code, **Then** the system should capture clicks, opens, form submissions and trigger workflows based on these actions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when payment processing fails during checkout?
- How does the system handle email deliverability issues?
- What occurs when a user tries to access a funnel that's been deleted?
- How does the platform manage high traffic spikes during product launches?
- What happens when third-party integrations (payment processors, email services) go down?
- What happens when web scraping encounters anti-bot protection or rate limiting?
- How does the system handle websites that change their structure frequently?
- What occurs when scraped data contains invalid or duplicate information?
- How does the platform manage large-scale data collection without violating terms of service?
- What happens when login credentials expire or become invalid during scraping?
- How does the system handle two-factor authentication requirements for protected sites?
- What occurs when websites change their login process or add new security measures?
- How does the platform handle session timeouts during long scraping operations?
